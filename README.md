Tic Tac Toe Shuffle is a variant of Tic Tac Toe where the players are only allotted three pieces each. 
If wishing to place a fourth piece, the player must instead move one of their previously placed pieces to the new place on the board,
ensuring each player only has three pieces on the board at any given time.
